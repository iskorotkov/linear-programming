# Linear Programming functions

I used this project to solve linear programming assignment at the university. It was an experiment and it won't be developed in any way.

The program can solve LP task using two methods:

- graphically (though it can't build graph, you can do it manually)
- using simplex method with tables (though you have to analyze and write how to solve each particular case)
